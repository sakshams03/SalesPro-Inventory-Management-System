This is a fully functional codebase for Inventory control system.
The project is made keeping in mind the SOLID principles and other best practices.
The code is deployed on Azure and to maximise the security, all communications between the azure components are based on Managed identities which means there is no need to manage tokens and their life cycles.
This is highly scalable, and can be extended as and when needed.
Please go through architectural diagram to understand high level design.
